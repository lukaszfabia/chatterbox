# Chatterbox

Simple `chat web app` writted with microservices (simplified **CQRS** pattern and event-driven architecture). Microservices communicate with each other by RabbitMQ broker. 

## Getting started

Before we start copy `.env.sample` in the root of the project and fill blank keys. You also need to do it with other services.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

> [!TIP]
> To generate .env's just use `init.sh`!

```bash
bash init.sh
```

or

```bash
sudo chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```

Just make sure you have installed `Docker`, `docker-compose`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
